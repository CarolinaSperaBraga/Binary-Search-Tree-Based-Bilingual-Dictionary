# Bilingual Dictionary Using Binary Search Trees  

This project implements a bilingual dictionary that enables fast word translations between two languages using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. The system efficiently stores and retrieves words, allowing users to quickly find translations based on a predefined dataset.

## Functionality  
- **Data Storage**: Words and their translations are stored in two separate BSTs for efficient retrieval.  
- **Fast Lookup**: The BST structure allows for quick searches, reducing the time complexity compared to linear search methods.  
- **Bidirectional Translation**: Users can request translations in both directions (e.g., English to Portuguese and vice versa).  
- **Error Handling**: The system identifies cases where translations are missing or when input formatting is incorrect.  

## Applications  
- Digital dictionaries and language learning tools.  
- Efficient word lookup for text processing applications.  
- Optimized language translation for small-scale systems with structured data.
